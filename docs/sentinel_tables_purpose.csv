actor_states, (chainwatch) Associates actors states as single-level trees with CIDs pointing to complete state tree with the root CID (head) for that actor's state.
actors, (chainwatch) Associates the actor's state root CID (head) with the chain state root CID from which it decends. Includes account ID nonce and balance at each state.
block_cids, (chainwatch) All distinct block CIDs seen on network independent of its validity
block_drand_entries, (chainwatch) Block CIDs and the Drand round used within
block_messages, (chainwatch) Message CIDs and the Blocks CID which contain them
block_parents, (chainwatch) Block CIDs to many parent Block CIDs
blocks, (chainwatch) Block Header data for all blocks seen on network independent of its validity
blocks_synced, (chainwatch) Work management table for chainwatch tracking synced_at when the block was first seen and processed_at when the block was successfully processed
chain_block, (telegraf) Reports of blocks seen by nodes across the network along with timing information. Includes libp2p peer ID and the hostname of the reporting telegraf agent. Some metadata about block headers are included here.
chain_economics, (chainwatch) Economic summaries per state root CID.
chain_mpool, (telegraf) Reports of messages seen by nodes across the network along with timing information (time and recorded_at are the same value as timestamp_tz and unix nanoseconds respectively)
chain_power, (chainwatch) Power summaries per state root CID.
chain_reward, (chainwatch) Reward summaries per state root CID.
chain_tipset, (telegraf) Reports of tipsets seen by nodes across the network along with timing information (time is expected epoch time according to FIL and recorded_at is when the tipset was last updated by the reporting node). New reports will update the old such that the block counts on the most recent records may be volatile as new data arrives from those nodes while the tipset forms.
