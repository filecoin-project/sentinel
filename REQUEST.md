# **Collaboration Request Process**

## **Overview**

This document outlines the process for other teams within our organization to request collaborations, including feature requests, new datasets, and new data pipelines. We will leverage GitHub issues and templates to streamline the collaboration request workflow. The process includes a discussion and approval phase to evaluate the priority of the request and determine whether it should be included in the current roadmap.

## **Process Steps**

### **Step 1: Initiating a Collaboration Request**

1. The requesting team creates a new issue in the [Sentinel repository](https://github.com/filecoin-project/sentinel/issues) on GitHub.
2. Select the appropriate issue template for the collaboration request. (Provide details on how to access the templates.)

### **Step 2: Completing the Collaboration Request Template**

1. In the newly created issue, the requesting team fills out the collaboration request template, including the following information:
    - **Request Summary**: A concise summary of the collaboration request.
    - **Request Details**: Detailed information about the collaboration request, including specific requirements, goals, and any supporting documentation or references.
    - **Timeline**: Desired timeline or deadline for the collaboration request.
    - **Resources**: Specify the resources required for the collaboration, such as engineers, data scientists, or specific tools.
    - **Impact Assessment**: An assessment of the potential impact or value of the collaboration request.
    - **Dependencies**: Any dependencies or constraints related to the collaboration request.

### **Step 3: Review and Discussion**

1. The assigned team lead or engineering manager reviews the collaboration request issue.
2. The team lead or engineering manager facilitates a discussion with the relevant stakeholders to evaluate the collaboration request.
3. The discussion may involve clarifying the requirements, assessing the feasibility, and considering the impact on the current roadmap.

### **Step 4: Decision and Approval**

1. Based on the discussion, the team lead or engineering manager makes a decision regarding the collaboration request.
2. The decision may include one of the following outcomes:
    - Approved: The collaboration request is approved, and the team will proceed with incorporating it into the current roadmap.
    - Not Approved: The collaboration request is not approved, and the team will not proceed with it.
    - Further Evaluation Needed: Additional information or assessment is required before making a decision. In this case, the team lead or engineering manager communicates the necessary steps to the requesting team.

### **Step 5: Communication and Follow-up**

1. The team lead or engineering manager updates the collaboration request issue with the decision.
2. If approved, the team lead or engineering manager communicates the next steps and assigns the necessary resources to the collaboration request.
3. If not approved, the team lead or engineering manager provides feedback and reasons for the decision.
4. The requesting team and relevant stakeholders are notified of the decision and any subsequent actions.

## **Conclusion**

Implementing this collaboration request process using GitHub issues and templates will help streamline the workflow and ensure that collaboration requests are evaluated, prioritized, and incorporated into the roadmap effectively. By following these steps, we can promote transparency, accountability, and efficient communication within our organization.
