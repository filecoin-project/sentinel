[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/filecoin-project/sentinel.svg?style=svg&circle-token=6dee046c14c81af4e1c526fa36ebcb486677be69)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/filecoin-project/sentinel)

Sentinel is a collection of services which monitor the health and function of the Filecoin network. 

A **Visor** process collects _permenant_ Filecoin chain meterics from a [**Lotus**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/) daemon, and writes them to a [**TimescaleDB**](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb), a time-series and relational datastore.

Many [**Drone**](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/sentinel-drone) instances collect _ephemeral_, node-specific Lotus metrics and write them to the same TimescaleDB.

The metrics are displayed in [**Grafana**](https://github.com/grafana/grafana). A set of _very important queries_ are captured in Grafana to track and alert on critical performance and economic health indicators over time.

## Setup

### Build and Start Sentinel

Follow the [Lotus installation instructions](https://lotu.sh/en+getting-started) to install dependencies for your operating system.

0. Start lotus daemon.
1. `git clone git@github.com:filecoin-project/sentinel.git`
2. `cd sentinel`
3. `make deps`
4. `make run-lotus`
5. (In another window) `build/lotus sync wait` which blocks until lotus finishes syncing the chain.
6. `make run-docker` to start Docker services
7. (In separate windows) `make run-drone` and `make run-visor`.

### Configure Grafana

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to open Grafana.
2. Login with username and password as `admin`. Change the admin password.

The datasource and dashboards are provisioned by the config in 

- `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yml`
- `grafana/provisioning/datasources/timescaledb.yml`

## Managing Sentinel

### Build

Note: Build artifacts are put into `./build` path. If you want to force building without `make clean`ing first, you can also `make -B <target>`.

`make` - produces all build targets (lotus, visor, and drone binaries)

`make lotus` - only builds the lotus daemon binary

`make visor` - only builds the visor binary

`make drone` - only builds the Sentinel Drone agent binary

### Run/Stop

`make run-drone` - start development Sentinel Drone process with debug output (uses configuration at `build/drone.conf`)

`make run-lotus` - start lotus daemon with default settings (lotus repo at `$(HOME)/.lotus`)

`make run-visor` - start visor binary. The database and repo path can be changed from default via `LOTUS_DB` and `LOTUS_REPO` environment variables. (Defaults to `LOTUS_DB ?= postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disabled` and `LOTUS_REPO ?= $(HOME)/.lotus`.

`make run-docker` - start docker services (currently TimescaleDB, Grafana)

`make stop-drone` - stop development Sentinel Drone process

`make stop-visor` - stop visor process

`make stop-lotus` - stop lotus daemon process

`make stop-docker` - stop all docker services

### Management/Installation

`make install-services` - Install lotus-daemon, sentinel-drone, sentinel-visor as systemd services

`make replace-services` - Build lotus-daemon, sentinel-drone, sentinel-visor and replace existing binaries without deploying configuration files

`make clean-services` - Uninstall lotus-daemon, sentinel-drone, sentinel-visor as systemd services (not logs or configuration)

Install individual services:

`make install-drone-service`

`make install-lotus-service`

`make install-visor-service`

Replace individual services:

`make replace-drone-service`

`make replace-lotus-service`

`make replace-visor-service`

Also works with their `make clean-*-service` counterparts.

`make clean` - removes build artifacts

`make clean-state` - stops and destroys docker service volumes (which resets TimescaleDB and Grafana settings and configuration)
