# Sentinel

A Filecoin Network Monitoring and Analysis System

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/filecoin-project/sentinel.svg?style=svg&circle-token=6dee046c14c81af4e1c526fa36ebcb486677be69)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/filecoin-project/sentinel)

## Background

Sentinel is a collection of services which monitor the health and function of the Filecoin network. The system consists of TimescaleDB, a time-series and relational datastore, which captures metrics from interesting parts of the network and is exposed via Grafana, which presents the data via helpful and informative graphs and provides alerting and annotating for real-time monitoring.

The metrics are pushed to TimescaleDB from Telegraf-based agents refered to as Sentinel Drones and a centralized data processing pipeline driven by [Chainwatch](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/tree/master/cmd/lotus-chainwatch) with [Lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/) attached as a source of truth for immutable network state.

## Setup

### Build and Start Sentinel

Follow the [Lotus installation instructions](read https://lotu.sh/en+getting-started) to install dependencies for your operating system.

0. Start lotus daemon.
1. `git clone git@github.com:filecoin-project/sentinel.git`
2. `cd sentinel`
3. `make deps`
4. `make run-lotus`
5. (In another window) `build/lotus sync wait` which blocks until lotus finishes syncing the chain.
6. `make run-docker` to start Docker services
7. (In separate windows) `make run-drone` and `make run-chainwatch`.

### Configure Grafana

1. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to open Grafana.
2. Login with username and password as `admin`. Change the admin password.

The datasource and dashboards are provisioned by the config in 

- `grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yml`
- `grafana/provisioning/datasources/timescaledb.yml`

## Managing Sentinel

### Build

Note: Build artifacts are put into `./build` path. If you want to force building without `make clean`ing first, you can also `make -B <target>`.

`make` - produces all build targets (lotus, chainwatch, and drone binaries)

`make lotus` - only builds the lotus daemon binary

`make chainwatch` - only builds the chainwatch binary

`make drone` - only builds the Sentinel Drone agent binary

### Run/Stop

`make run-drone` - start development Sentinel Drone process with debug output (uses configuration at `build/drone.conf`)

`make run-lotus` - start lotus daemon with default settings (lotus repo at `$(HOME)/.lotus`)

`make run-chainwatch` - start chainwatch binary. The database and repo path can be changed from default via `LOTUS_DB` and `LOTUS_REPO` environment variables. (Defaults to `LOTUS_DB ?= postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disabled` and `LOTUS_REPO ?= $(HOME)/.lotus`.

`make run-docker` - start docker services (currently TimescaleDB, Grafana)

`make stop-drone` - stop development Sentinel Drone process

`make stop-chainwatch` - stop chainwatch process

`make stop-lotus` - stop lotus daemon process

`make stop-docker` - stop all docker services

### Management/Installation

`make install-services` - Install lotus-daemon, sentinel-drone, chainwatch as systemd services

`make upgrade-services` - Build lotus-daemon, sentinel-drone, chainwatch and replace existing binaries without deploying configuration files

`make clean-services` - Uninstall lotus-daemon, sentinel-drone, chainwatch as systemd services (not logs or configuration)

Install individual services:

`make install-drone-service`

`make install-lotus-service`

`make install-chainwatch-service`

Upgrade individual services:

`make upgrade-drone-service`

`make upgrade-lotus-service`

`make upgrade-chainwatch-service`

Also works with their `make clean-*-service` counterparts.

`make clean` - removes build artifacts

`make clean-state` - stops and destroys docker service volumes (which resets TimescaleDB and Grafana settings and configuration)
