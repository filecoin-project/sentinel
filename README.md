[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/filecoin-project/sentinel.svg?style=svg&circle-token=6dee046c14c81af4e1c526fa36ebcb486677be69)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/filecoin-project/sentinel)

Sentinel is a collection of services which monitor the health and function of the Filecoin network. 

A **Visor** process collects _permenant_ Filecoin chain meterics from a [**Lotus**](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/) daemon, and writes them to a [**TimescaleDB**](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb), a time-series and relational datastore.

Many [**Drone**](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/sentinel-drone) instances collect _ephemeral_, node-specific Lotus metrics and write them to the same TimescaleDB.

The metrics are displayed in [**Grafana**](https://github.com/grafana/grafana). A set of _very important queries_ are captured in Grafana to track and alert on critical performance and economic health indicators over time.

## Quick start

In their own shells, run Lotus and wait:

- `lotus damon`
- `lotus sync wait` 

Then from this repo, with the submodules updated, run all the Sentinel components:

- `make run-docker`
- `make run-telegraf`
- `make run-chainwatch`

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and fetch the submodules. `make` will help you out:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:filecoin-project/sentinel.git
$ cd sentinel
$ make deps
git submodule update --init --recursive
...
```

Now we need to get Lotus built and syncing the chain.

### Lotus

Sentinel requires a running lotus daemon that has completed synching the chain locally. A full sync of the [Testnet](https://network.filecoin.io/#testnet) takes days. You can test against the [Nerpa network](https://network.filecoin.io/#nerpa) to try sentinel out.

Follow the [Lotus install and setup instructions](https://docs.filecoin.io/get-started/lotus/installation), to install the dependencies, check out the branch for the network you want to join, (e.g. `ntwrk-nerpa`), and build a local copy of lotus. If you need to test against testnet, see [Testing against Testnet](#testing-against-testnet).

Run Lotus to start syncing.
```console
$ lotus daemon
```

In a sperate shell, ask lotus to tell us when it has finished syncing.
```console
$ lotus sync wait
lotus sync wait
Worker 0: Target Height: 9099	Target: [bafy2bzacecqrt46shkioecxkt6mrdvi5xd73wh2gonrp3bhxfut6szc2labj6]	State: complete	Height: 9099
Done!
```

Now let's set up the Database.

### TimescaleDB

A [`docker-compose`](./docker-compose.yml) file is provided that will spin up a TimescaleDB and a Grafana instance to query it. Check that you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is relatively painless.

```console
$ make run-docker
```

Now we need to generate some data with Visor and Drone

### Visor

In a new shell run Visor. [By default](https://github.com/filecoin-project/sentinel/blob/fc8e8556e2f336c2a46db066571d46400d978d85/Makefile#L65-L69) it will read lotus data from `$(HOME)/.lotus` and write to the local database container we just started at `localhost:5432`.

```shell
$ make run-chainwatch
...
2020-09-18T15:22:12.283+0100	INFO	chainwatch	lotus-chainwatch/main.go:17	Starting chainwatch v0.5.7+git.b8bbbf3e
2020-09-18T15:22:12.286+0100	INFO	chainwatch	lotus-chainwatch/run.go:74	Remote version: 0.7.0+git.992073d2
2020-09-18T15:22:12.305+0100	INFO	syncer	syncer/blockssub.go:18	Capturing incoming blocks
2020-09-18T15:22:12.343+0100	INFO	syncer	syncer/sync.go:173	Found starting point for syncing	{"blockCID": "bafy2bzaceaqnt4n37od7aqwbvp2qa2bqrb533wbztdwmxzgqtcl5xtbay5gqg", "height": 3715}
...
```

If there are no `ERROR`sm then it is now writing filecoin chain metrics to the database.

### Drone

In another shell, run Drone. [By default](./scripts/telegraf.conf.default) it reads prometheus metrics from Lotus at http://127.0.0.1:1234/debug/metrics and the Lotus data dir at `$(HOME)/.lotus`. It writes to the database container `localhost:5432`. Edit `scripts/telegraf.conf` if you need to customise those values.

```shell
$ make run-telegraf
...
2020-09-18T11:24:22Z D! [agent] Successfully connected to outputs.postgresql
2020-09-18T11:24:31Z D! [outputs.postgresql] Wrote batch of 38 metrics in 588.361501ms
2020-09-18T11:24:32Z D! [inputs.lotus] Recorded lotus info
2020-09-18T11:24:32Z D! [inputs.lotus] Recorded pending mpool messages
2020-09-18T11:24:32Z I! [inputs.lotus] Service workers started
...
```

Verify that it connects to postgresql and is able to read data from lotus without errors.

### Grafana

Grafana and a set of Sentinel dashboards are provisioned in a container along with the TimescaleDB as part of the `make run-docker` target.

Visit http://localhost:3000 to open Grafana and login with username and password as `admin`. You should now see a `sentinel` folder with dashboards in. Have an explore, and make some more! Look at [`./grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yml`](./grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yml) to see how the existing dashboards are provisioned. You can export new dashboards as JSON from the grafana UI and update that file to add new ones.

## Managing Sentinel

### Build

Note: Build artifacts are put into `./build` path. If you want to force building without `make clean`ing first, you can also `make -B <target>`.

`make` - produces all build targets (lotus, chainwatch, and telegraf)

`make lotus` - only builds the lotus daemon binary

`make chainwatch` - only builds the chainwatch binary

`make telegraf` - only builds the telegraf agent binary

### Run/Stop

`make run-telegraf` - start development Telegraf process with debug output (uses configuration at `build/telegraf.conf`)

`make run-lotus` - start lotus daemon with default settings (lotus repo at `$(HOME)/.lotus`)

`make run-chainwatch` - start chainwatch binary. The database and repo path can be changed from default via `LOTUS_DB` and `LOTUS_REPO` environment variables. (Defaults to `LOTUS_DB ?= postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disabled` and `LOTUS_REPO ?= $(HOME)/.lotus`.

`make run-docker` - start docker services (currently TimescaleDB, Grafana)

`make stop-telegraf` - stop development Telegraf process

`make stop-chainwatch` - stop chainwatch process

`make stop-lotus` - stop lotus daemon process

`make stop-docker` - stop all docker services

### Management/Installation

`make install-services` - Install lotus, telegraf, chainwatch as systemd services

`make upgrade-services` - Build lotus, telegraf, chainwatch and replace existing binaries without deploying configuration files

`make clean-services` - Uninstall lotus, telegraf, chainwatch as systemd services (not logs or configuration)

Install individual services:

`make install-telegraf-service`

`make install-lotus-service`

`make install-chainwatch-service`

Upgrade individual services:

`make upgrade-telegraf-service`

`make upgrade-lotus-service`

`make upgrade-chainwatch-service`

Also works with their `make clean-*-service` counterparts.

`make clean` - removes build artifacts

`make clean-state` - stops and destroys docker service volumes (which resets TimescaleDB and Grafana settings and configuration)

## Testing against Testnet

A complete local sync of the `testnet` takes days. To complete it in a reasonable time you need a copy of an already sync'd lotus data dir from a friendly filecoin operator.At present, regular chain snapshots, as described in https://docs.filecoin.io/get-started/lotus/chain-snapshots don't work for chainwatch because they are incomplete exports.

To take a full copy of a Lotus data dir

- shutdown existing lotus
- run lotus daemon on your new box for just a moment (to initialize the repo path)
- tar/copy/transport .../.lotus/datastore into the same path on your destination
- start old and new daemons
- ðŸŽ‰
